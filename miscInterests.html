                    Beyond CS and Art, some of favorite things to do/play on my free time, like many CS majors, is Video Games! In particular, anything
                    by FromSoftware is a personal favorite from Darksouls to Sekiro. Even though these are my favorites I enjoy almost every genre of game
                    there is, and my interest in them is also largely what inspired me to go into CS so that I could learn how to make my own.

                <p>
                    Besides games, other media I find enjoyable is TV (streaming). By far my favorite series are "Breaking Bad", "Better Call Saul", and "The Sopranos".
                    Below is one of my favorite quotes from "The Sopranos", of what I think is one of the funniest insults the characters throw at each other.
