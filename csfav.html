                    Java is one of my favorite programming languages. It's the first one I've learned, and the one I've used
                    the most in my projects by far. In particular I like creating GUI applications with Swing and JavaFX, which
                    I've done both in Eclipse and NetBeans.

                <p> 
                    Python, is another favorite of mine, as it's relatively simple and fast to get a program made. In particular I like
                    it for making simple scripts and also games with the Pygame library.

                    Godot! Not a language (although it does have it's own built-in scripting langauge called GDScript), but my preferred game engine, 
                    <i>mainly due to it's pricing and licensing</i>, but it's also an elegant enough engine especially for one thats completely 
                    free and open-source.
