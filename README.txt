Individual Assignment: Simple Multiplayer Game 
-   This is a simple implementation of connect 4 that's played "locally", meaning as if two people
    were in the same room together.
-   Board state is managed and updated in a JS file linked to index which also updates the html visually and
    produces a basic animation for the pieces being placed through requestAnimationFrame.
-   Board on the html end is just a 2D table of pngs that are switched betwen being blank, red, or blue to represent
    the current board state.
